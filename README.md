# Chess
Play chess, against yourself or a friend!

## Setup
There is a <kbd>Chess.zip</kbd> that includes the application. However, to build yourself, you will need to:
- Set up [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- Set up [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) (OpenGL version 3.3 or higher, Core); there is a glad.c file included in the repo but it may not work on your computer
- Set up [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html)
- Include <kbd>fragmentShader_pieces.frag</kbd>, <kbd>fragmentShader_shapes.frag</kbd>, <kbd>vertexShader_pieces.vert</kbd>, <kbd>vertexShader_shapes.vert</kbd>, and the <kbd>textures</kbd> directory in the same folder as the application
